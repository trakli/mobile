### Improving Documentation

Improving documentation is a great way to start contributing. You can help by:

- Updating or expanding the project's README.
- Creating or improving guides and tutorials.
- Ensuring code comments are clear and helpful.

### Submitting Code Changes

We follow the [GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) for our development process. To contribute code:

- Fork the repository.
- Create a new branch (`git checkout -b feature/your-feature`).
- Make your changes.
- Ensure your changes adhere to our [Style Guide](#style-guide).
- Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add some feature'`).
- Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/your-feature`).
- Open a pull request.

Please ensure your code passes all tests and does not introduce any new issues.

## Setting Up the Development Environment

To contribute to this project, you need to set up the development environment with the following minimum requirements:

- **Flutter 3.22.2 or higher**: Ensure you have Flutter installed. Follow the instructions on the [official Flutter website](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install) to install Flutter.

To check your Flutter version, run:
```bash
flutter --version
```

To set up the project:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone git@github.com:whilesmart/trakli-mobile.git # or use gh repo clone whilesmart/trakli-mobile
    cd trakli-mobile
    ```

2. Fetch the dependencies:
    ```bash
    flutter pub get
    ```

3. **Set up Git hooks**:
    
    Install Git hooks to run pre-commit checks automatically:
    
    ```bash
    dart run husky install
    ```
    
    This sets up hooks that run linting, Flutter analysis, and validate GitHub Actions workflow files before commits. **Note**: You must install action-validator (step 4) for the GitHub Actions validation to work.

4. **Install action-validator**:
    
    The Git hooks validate GitHub Actions workflow files, which requires [action-validator](https://github.com/mpalmer/action-validator). Install it following the [installation instructions](https://github.com/mpalmer/action-validator#installation) in their documentation.

5. Run the project:
    ```bash
    flutter run
    ```

## Style Guide

Please ensure your code follows our style guidelines:

- Use Dart's formatting standards (`flutter format .`).
- Write clear, concise comments where necessary.
- Follow best practices for Flutter and Dart.

- translation: run this to generate translations after adding text to json files
    ```bash
    flutter pub run easy_localization:generate -S "assets/translations/" -O "lib/gen/translations" - o "codegen_loader.g.dart" -f keys
    ```
- Use translations by **LocaleKeys.app_name.tr()**

- assets(images/SVGs): run this after adding an asset image or SVG 
    ```bash
    fluttergen -c pubspec.yaml
    ```
- Use asset by
  For SVGs:Assets.images.svg
  For Images:Assets.images.image.path

## Commit Messages

Write clear and meaningful commit messages. Use the following structure:

- **feat**: A new feature.
- **fix**: A bug fix.
- **docs**: Documentation only changes.
- **style**: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, etc.).
- **refactor**: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature.
- **test**: Adding missing or correcting existing tests.
- **chore**: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools and libraries.
